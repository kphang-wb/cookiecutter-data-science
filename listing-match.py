* 
* Program: WBMatch
*
*
*
* Definition: The WBMatch function will allow the user to enter in as little
* as a single string to search for a matching WayBase ID. The function
* currently supports name, postal code, bounding boxes, and generic location
* strings all searchable without using Google by utilizing a combination of 
* geopy and pgeocode. The function will only output results if there is a
* "confident" match i.e., the data top matching result is clearly a far better
* match than any other response hits.
*
#   Parameters:
#       client: the Elasticsearch client with login information must be passed
#               to the function in order to retrieve IDs. REQUIRED
#
#       namestring: a string variable with the charity name, REQUIRED.
#
#       postcode: a string containing the postal code of the charity. Must be
#               formatted approximately correct (missing space or changed case
#               is fine, but can't contain incorrect characters). If improperly
#               formatted the function will fall back to the name only. Useful
#               if only for the fact that it is done entirely offline. Can be
#               included with a boundaries parameter to even more closely limit
#               the results.
#
#       boundaries: Can be either a list of top_left and bottom_right coordinates
#                   for a bounding box, or a string containing an address/city/
#                   region etc. Searches only within Canada. This slows the
#                   function from 5it/sec to 1it/sec maximum as the OSM project
#                   is rate limited (but FREE!). Generic query is then converted
#                   to a tight bounding box by Nominatim/OSM.
#        
#       epsilon: The density/distance parameter for the clustering algorithm.
#                Default is 4. Increase to make more conservative. Should never
#                be reduced below ~1.5. Lowering increases false positives.
#                Raising increases false negatives (eventually will never 
#                return a match at all).
#
# DiagnosticDictionary: Below shows how the dictionary is laid out (the keys  #
# you can interact with to add columns). Will return BOOLEAN T/F values for   #
# exact matches between the WB hit value and the inputted data. Note that     #
# using the DD wil also trigger an additional output of Levenstein distance   #
# between the inputted namestring and it's best matching WB Alias. The        #
# example below lists the exact field name returned from the ElasticSearch    #
# query. Note that your input values may have to be reformatted to match the  #
# standard WB value.                                                          #
#
#   DiagnosticDictionary = {
#    'DenomBool': 'tags.denomination',
#    'PostBool' : 'postalCode',
#    'FaithBool' : 'tags.faith',
#    'AgeBool' : 'tags.age',
#    'CategoryBool': 'tags.category',
#    'CultureBool' : 'tags.culture',
#    'FaithstreamBool' : 'tags.faithstream',
#    'LanguageBool' : 'tags.language'
#    }
#
#       Funny note: If a postal code is provided, often the name and postal code
#               alone is the most accurate and fastest method. For files like
#               "Liens entre les Ã©glises et les paroisses", the address boundary
#               inclusion only aided in adding 1 more hit. The postal code
#               boundaries are pretty darn accurate. Use name + location (PC)
#               whenever possible. This is 5-15x faster, with maybe a 2% change
#               in accuracy. In some cases the boundary can actually return
#               fewer hits since it will have to increase the boundaries too
#               far before submitting the ES_Query, making the confidence in
#               separating scores lower.   
#
#       Another Note: As per Rhodri's information, the elasticsearch query
#       will choke on namestrings that have the location in the name, for
#       example "Pinegrove Fellowship Church - Port Carling". If at all possible
#       strip location out of the name itself. It can still say Pinegrove if
#       that is indeed the churches name, it is the addition of extraneous info
#       into the name field that the ES Query really struggles with. 
*
* Outputs: ID, Confidence, WB_Name, WB_AKA, WB_Locality, PC, DENOM, LEV, CC
* as a list. I prefer to then apply pd.Series to pull that DF column into 
* multiple.

#---------------------------------Change log----------------------------------#
*
* Created on Tue Mar 31 12:15:13 2020
* Finalized on Thu Apr 16 2020
* Between April 16 and 22 there were numerous undocumented bug fixes based on
* real-data usage experience.
* 20200422 Bug fix: added a check permission step to get_boundaries to prevent 
* returning 'None' to the query.
* 20200423 Improvement: Postal code now removes the leading whitespace before 
* checking centre whitespace.
* 20200423 Improvement: Boundary will now at least once try to back out and get
* a more generic bounding box if the street address was too close. Doubles the
* algorithm runtime (if there's to small a box), but may prove more accurate.
* 20200423 General Bugfixes. Ensured that when a sole hit is returned from a 
* postal code, it is still compared against other hits for confidence values.
* Some will still return sole match since the initial query can match so well
* from elastic search! These are tagged 'SOle Return Before Clustering'
* 20200423 Improvement: Added the Diagnostic Dictionary, a
* way to output more information to check veracity of matches.
* 20200427 Improvement: Added a combined confidence score to make Nathan's life
* easier. If there is a normal confidence score and a lev, averages them
* together. If there is only lev, reports lev.
* 20200428 Improvement/Bugfix: After having a few ES_Query failures from
* TrasportErrors, added a "retry" to WB_Match to attempt the query a few more
* times before dumping out. This fixed some frustrating breaks where it had 
* read 3/4 through a large file. Also recommend increasing the client timeout
* setting to 30 seconds at time of creation if you have my crappy internet.
* 20200429 Cleanup: Output changed to list instead of pd.Series for greater
* flexability. Removed extraneous options from WB_Match since normal use-case
* will likely need as much information outputted as possible (old toggles let
* return as little as just ID or ID and CONF values).

#                   is rate limited (but FREE!). Generic query is then converted
#                   to a tight bounding box by Nominatim/OSM. String is
#                   processed left-to-right then right-to-left if that fails,
#                   so address may be input in any order i.e., "street, city,

#                   Can also input a dictionary with keys are one of:

#                   structured query has less chance of being misinterpreted.
#                   Polygon type boundaries should be entered in polygon param
#                   since not all queries are capable of returning a polygon in
#                   OSM/Google. 
#
#         polygon: an array of coordinates that form a polygon. In the same   #
# format as the boundaries for the bounding box, only many more entries than  #
# the two corners! Uses 'should' boolean filter as in original function       #
#           Currently bugged: 'parse exception', geo_point expected. Seems to

#                   address/city/region etc. Searches only within Canada. 
#                   Generic query is then converted to a tight bounding box by 
#                   Nominatim/OSM or Google. Bounding envelope is VERY tight so
